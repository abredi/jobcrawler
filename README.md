![Hireable](https://cdn.rawgit.com/hiendv/hireable/master/styles/default/yes.svg) [![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/wrakc/Bubble-Sort---Microverse)](https://repl.it/@aliabdulaziz/jobcrawler)

> The web scrapping web application to scrap and display the latest jobs from ethiopian largest job site. I developed this web scrapping project to get the best practices that I already learned in the previous projects, like setting-up a code linter, using GitFlow, testing your business logic, writing good commit messages, and a good README.
